Exercise 5:  Bottle Deposits
In many jurisdictions a small deposit is added to drink 
containers to encourage people to recycle them.  In one 
particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter 
or less have a $0.10 deposit, and drink containers holding 
more than one liter have $0.25 deposit.
Write a program that reads the number of containers of each 
size from the user.  Your program should continue by computing 
and displaying the refund that will be received for returning 
those containers.  Format the output so that it includes a dollar
